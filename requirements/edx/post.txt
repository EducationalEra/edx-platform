# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!

# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @edx/ospr - to check licensing
#   * @edx/devops - to check system requirements

# python-saml depends on lxml, which is referenced in base.txt. A bug exists
# in setuptools 18.0.1 which results in an infinite loop during
# resolution of this dependency during compilation. So we need to install
# python-saml only after lxml has been successfully installed. 

python-saml==2.2.1
requests[security]==2.19.1
cryptography==2.2.2
enum34==1.1.6
urllib3==1.23
